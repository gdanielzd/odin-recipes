                <h2>Homemade Lasagna</h2>
                <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

                        <p>
                            Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the

                            Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a
                            binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
